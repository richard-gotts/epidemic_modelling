# Epidemic Modelling

This is one of the Mathematical Biology assessed practicals I completed in the first year of my Natural Sciences undergraduate degree.

The program I wrote considers the ways in which we can model epidemics. This was particularly relevant work as it was completed in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.

I considered the following:

- The basic reproductive ratio of the virus as a function of recovery rate with fixed rate of infection-producing contacts and population size
- Calculating the critical density of individuals required for an epidemic given rate of infection and rate of recovery, starting with one infected individual
- Using systems of differential equations in the SIR model (susceptible, infected, recovered)
- Predicting final epidemic size
